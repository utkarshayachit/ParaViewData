This dataset is from a CTH simulation of an aluminum penetrator into a
steel plate. The simulation is 2D axisymmetric, so the x-coordinate
gives the radius and the y-coordinate is the height z.

The purpose is to test the calculation of "derived variables" in the
CTH reader (spcth files). spcth files contain variable values for each
element in the domain. To reduce file sizes, CTH does not write
derived variables to spcth files because derived variables can be
computed from the variables that are written. CTH also write hscth
files, which include tracer data. Tracers record variable values at
particular locations in the domain, and are much smaller than spcth
files. CTH does write derived variables to hscth files.

The attached dataset includes an spcth file and an hscth file, and
SESAME files for copper and steel.

The CTH data has been reviewed and approved for unlimited release by
Sandia National Laboratories as SAND 2011-4874P and SAND 2011-4875P.
