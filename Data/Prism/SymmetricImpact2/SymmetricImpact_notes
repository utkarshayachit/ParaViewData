This dataset is from a simulation of a symmetric impact of two proxium
flyer plates. The initially solid flyers are shocked to a high
pressure liquid state, then release to a low pressure liquid, and
finally expand through a mixed phase regime.  (There are no strength
or fracture models so the flyer material always remains in one
"piece".)  The simulation is 2D planar. Note that the height (y) is
only one element in thickness, so it is effectively a 1D simulation.

The purpose is to test the display of 300 and 400 series tables in the
Prism plugin.  Cell data in the exodus file or tracer data in the
hscth file can be displayed on the EOS surface. The sesame files are
for proxium, a fictitious material, which is material 1 in the
simulation data files.

The data has been reviewed and approved for unlimited release by
Sandia National Laboratories as SAND 2010-7201 P.

The proxium material model has been reviewed and approved for
unlimited release under request number 5287382. "proxium.asc" is in
"Kerley" or "Sandia" SESAME format, while proxium.ses.mat.1.301 is in
LANL "Ship" format.
